"Acer software thats included is not exactly the most reliable. It works most of times but when it doesnt the computer will either need a reboot or the software needs to be eliminated from task manager. The charger is also excessively large. 330w charger is overkill for a 4060. It has thunderbolt charging but the computer will not recognize it as a full charge in order to actually game. It also does not game without the charger being plugged in (not like you""re supposed to). Other than that its fast, reliable, screen is bright and full, and does exactly what its supposed to!",The person dont like that this laptops charger is excessively large ,0,0.0

Pretty impressed with this laptop^s performance for the price.  In a perfect world it would include a second ssd slot but not a deal breaker.  It stays reletively cool while running Diablo 4 on ultra at 100-110 fps.  The predator sense tool is awesome as you can easily control the cpu and gpu clock and fan speed and can even create custom profiles for individual games.  The RTX 4060 feels great and allows the utilization of the latest and greatest features in the latest games such as DLSS.  This card will only get faster as drivers catch up to the technology. I dont see how this laptop can be beat for the price right now.,The person likes that this laptop stays relatively cool while running Diablo 4 at 100-110 FPS.,0,0.0

"When I first bought this laptop, I did have some issues that I had not experienced with my Acer Predator Helios 300: some games would crash, and/or not run properly for this level of hardware. I also had slight overheating issues. After Acer released updates to the BIOS, as well as Nvidia Driver updates, the issues I experienced did not occur anymore.Plays just about any game I have thrown at it, build quality seems great for Acer, and display is good enough for a mid-tier gaming laptop. I would""ve given 5 stars if not for the initial issues with the software/BIOS; but then again that can""t truly be attributed to the quality of this product.",The person likes to play games on this laptop,0,0.1

"I have had issues since I purchased it. One of the issues I""m having is with the PredatorSense software (that controls fans, overclocking, performance) freezes quite often. The biggest issue is the fact that it crashes while playing more intensive games. It was very rare at first, and I didnt play a whole lot when I first got it. When I got around to having more time, the crashes were more frequent and but by then I unfortunately had passed the Bestbuy return window. Now I have to deal with Acer directly. I""ve done a decent amount of diagnosing myself and with the help of others on the Acer forum, and it""s all but certain there is a hardware issue, likely cpu related.",The person dont like that the PredatorSense software freezes quite often and that it crashes while playing games,0,0.0

Great laptop most games old and new work with Nvidia g sync so everything looks great and super smooth.  Even old games.  Im able to play the most up to date games no issues.   I have over 20 games installed.  But getting close to max to me is a problem.If i had to make a complaint Id say battery life and space not enough for modern games.

"Really great RTX 4060 laptop, very strong TimeSpy score at stock ""Turbo"" setting, roughly 10,600 graphics score/ 16k CPU score stock. If you upgrade the RAM to 32 GB Corsair Vengeance (also sold at bestbuy) you can increase the CPU score by about 600 points (see images). With a strong OC on the GPU ( 280 MHz core ,  1250 MHz memory) you can manage around a 11,400 timespy graphics score which is roughly equivalent to a 150 watt 3070 Ti. Maximum GPU power consumption with OC was 108 watts, averaging around 103 watts, so the efficiency gains here are incredible. I actually managed to get 4th place in the world on TimeSpy for the 13700HX   4060 combo on stock hardware, that to me is incredible and speaks to the laptops excellent thermals/design. the GPU wants to boost past 2800 MHz for me, but it just cant because of VRel (Voltage reliability) It simply screams for more voltage, but nearly 2800 Mhz is incredible.   Liquid metal is the stock thermal paste and helps a lot! At stocks settings you""ll see roughly 90-100 watt GPU power usage, shame Nvidia limited these chips to 1 volt, but the efficiency is crazy, this laptop benches about the same as a 140 watt 3070, but uses much less power, so the temps dont exceed high 60 Celsius range. The 13700HX is incredibly powerful and as mentioned before, gains about 600 points in TimeSpy CPU score if you upgrade the RAM to a decent kit. It will pull up to 157 watts so it pairs very well with the GPU that wont usually go past 100 watts, combined this is a very powerful laptop that realistically could be a desktop replacement for many. The stock 1 TB NVMe drive is a Micron_3400_MTFDKBA1T0TFH , with speeds of 6500 MB/s read and 5000 MB/s write (See crystal disk mark image attached). There IS a second NVMe slot available, and a screw is included as well pre installed in the laptop, so adding another drive is easy! I did add another 2 TB NVMe drive and it was no problem, you""ll see it in one of the images attached. Im not sure why another reviewer claimed there was only one slot, but that information is very false and incorrect. RAM upgrade is similarly easy and can also be seem in an attached image. Taking the bottom cover off is also very easy. RAM/SSD upgrade should take you no longer than 10-15 mins. The screen is AU Optronics B160QAN03.H , its quite good and a very bright, I am impressed with it, it belongs in a laptop of this class.The stock RAM is Samsung M425R1GB4  8GB x 2 with timings of : 40-39-39-76 @ 4800 MHz with tRC 115 and tRFC 383. Its decent enough memory, but even the 4800 MHz Corsair Vengeance 16 GB sticks sold by BestBuy will provide a performance uplift (as seen in TimeSpy CPU score).I also updated the BIOS to the latest version 1.10 with no issues, the laptop came with version 1.06 Im impressed with the fan noise at idle/web browsing. Some laptops will sit there and nearly scream when in turbo mode, but not this one, its clear the cooling system with liquid metal easily absorbs any heat spikes without issue. the fans are also made of metal, which is quite unique and feels very premium and may even have some small performance benefit as metal is a better material for a fan in terms of heat dissipation. It will get loud during a full load benchmark but that is to be expected, but it ramps down very quickly after the load comes off.I also love the fact that the laptop has a MUX switch, but will also function automatically! this is great tech, so you dont have to worry about changing the switch all the time to get max performance from the 4060. You""ll get a notification and the screen may flash momentarily when it switches the display to the DGPU or iGPU, this is normal. Overall amazing laptop and highly recommend!",The person likes the high CPU performance of this laptop,0,0.0

"wonderful laptop.  at least play around, at least work in a 3D editor.  Fast normal screen.  Of the minuses: RAM 16 is not enough, the battery lasts for 4-4.5 hours of YouTube, the sound is slightly better than average.  Periodic crackling noises when listening with headphones, if I understand correctly, this is a problem with Intel drivers, can be solved by restarting the drivers.  So far I have only tracked one application causing this bug - an emulator in Android Studio.  (i use wires and wireless headphone).

"$400 price difference between 512 gb and 1tb space? Lower SSD speeds on the midrange and starting models?

"I bought this on sale during the holidays and, full disclosure, I returned it.First, it came preloaded with macOS ventura and had to update it before I could even use it.  Big fail.Second, I""ve used other macbook pros and the screen on THIS model was just -- worse.  Either apple is saving the defective panels for this model or I just got unlucky.  Either way, make sure you check it side-by-side with another top spec 14 inch (I did) before deciding whether it""s ok.To be clear, the screen was still not bad and everything else was ""almost"" standard macbook pro level.  The speakers sounded great, it was light and solid, and it is even a smidge lighter than the higher-spec 14 inch models.  I did like it, but couldn""t get past that the screen just didn""t seem right.On the ""ram"" side -- Best Buy really needs to stock the 16gb version of this (and hopefully run some sales on them).  While the 8gb did better than expected, I still hit bottlenecks.Overall, I went with a higher spec model when it was on sale and I still think that""s the better deal.

"This new Macbook Pro was purchased to replace a Macbook Pro that was purchased in 2011. At the time of the first purchase, I was using PC based operating systems, and I was frankly, sick and tired of PC""s going obsolete quick, or breaking down due to poor quality. So I went the Apple route and I never looked back. I was originally looking to purchase the cheaper Macbook Air until I read that the computer throttles down when it overheats. So I looked at the next one up. It had no mag safe charger, a must have in my opinion. I""ve seen too many PC""s with damaged motherboards because of torquing between the cord and unit. So I ended up with this MacBook. This mac is very fast with the M3 chip, although the M2 would have been ok. But the mag safe wasn""t available on that one, so I was back to this model. I wanted to get more RAM but the price was too much. In the old days of using PCs, I""d simply put more RAM in. But you can""t do this with this mac. They use what they call unified RAM, and its said that 8 MB (or unified), is like 16 onboard RAM. That was ok with me....as long as I no longer got that long lag time due to the system.Other pro""s:Graphics are good.In addition to password protection there is fingerprint access.Speed is goodWIFI Connectivity goodMag safe chargingSIRI availableCons: PriceGet a Mac......future proof yourself.",The user thinks this laptop is fast because of its M3 chip.,0,0.0

"The screen is very beautiful and the colors are nice! I used to have a MacBook and it always felt cramped.  This isn""t a problem with a 24 inch screen.  Eventhough it has only 8 gigs of ram, This iMac is always fast and hasn""t slowed down on me yet and I often have 5 or 6 tabs opened at once.  I only use it for web browsing, YouTube, and documents, and email.  If you want to play games then you will be limited because of the OS, however the Mac app store has tons of games you can play as well as Apple Arcade.The webcam is 1080p and I""ve used it for a few meetings so far and haven""t had any trouble. The sound and speakers sound nice too.  Overall this is a great all-in-one. It is neat and tidy and you won""t have all the cables running around.  I used an external usb c hub to plug it into my ethernet and haven""t had any problems. You don""t need to add $30 just for the ethernet. Just buy a 3rd party hub and plug it into the iMac (see picture)","The user uses the computer to watch YouTube, browse websites, documents, and emails.",0,0.0

"This is the most perfectly balanced build for a laptop I^ve ever seen. It^s as if Lenovo asked what excess, low-impact features can we trim from typical gaming laptops to create the best bang for buck build ever?. This is it. No frills, strictly business. Oh, and then they throw that crazy OLED display in. The display is seriously up there with the best and has no business being offered at this price point. I^m amazed. I know it doesn^t have g-sync, windows hello, studio quality speakers, or USB 4, but why would it? It doesn^t need those things to be great. People need to learn that the bells and whistles don^t matter compared to the meat and potatoes. I blame brands like Apple for tricking consumers into thinking they need every little thing to enjoy a computer. Oh, and with the money I saved over other offerings in this range, I could probably get a g-sync external monitor and some speakers. Maybe even a desk too.

"Bought this nearly four months ago. I only had to buy a new computer because my older HP Spectre 360 was no longer updating properly. I started looking at Lenova Yoga Book but did not love the price and it was on back order. I tried to wait and research computers more. Almost got the Spectre again (it was a good computer). Then finally another update and my Spectre was just about unworkable and could not wait to get new computer. I then needed one urgently which is not the best way to do it. I had at least looked at the Lenova so much and I saw how far they have come. I love the design and ease of use. I also really love the OLED screens on the computer. The only issue I have had is sometimes the fingerprint log in does not work. One night no matter what I did it would not let me in. I also could not get my password to work. I became quite worried indeed but after hard restart it worked fine and has never happened again. IIt had an update recently and since then not had issues logging in with fingerprint. Otherwise, it has been very fast turn on and go. No issues with my work applications (citrix). I like Lenova""s set up. I like the pen that comes with it but i really wish they had a way of attaching to computer, prior versions appeared to have a pocket. I am so afraid of loosing it that I keep not using it and leaving it at home. I think they should find a way to attach even if it could only be used while not in computer case.I am not a computer tech person. I know have good basic knowledge and get myself out of some basic computer issues but am not going to get into computer lingo. If you work in health care and have to chart forever on various remote desktops or perhaps do video telemed-this computer will do the job and also be fun to use when not doing such work. I am still going to buy a portable monitor to make travel work easier but am glad I purchased this one. The battery live is average. I had hoped it would be longer, but it is certainly workable.

The pen that comes with it could be better, when I touch and drag it across the screen it buffers and feels uncomfortable in the hand like nails on a chalkboard almost. Nevertheless, the fact that it comes with a pen and a case is better than other laptops/tablets I^ve come across. One other complaint I have is the touchpad is so large that I tend to rub my palm against it causing it to affect whatever is on the screen and it gets annoying. I got the champagne color and it is gorgeous, it^s more of a rosey pink color in person. It is unfortunate though that there^s almost no cases or screen protectors to find for it.

"YES! So I am a college student and I take a lot of online courses for my terms. So, I am on the market for a awesome laptop that I can A: consume movies and youtube at a high quality. B: Do school work fluidly without problems. and C: Have the option for tablet mode for writing notes or creative designs. So I first started getting the dell 7620 4k oled. I LOVED that laptop so much however it was giant for a 2 in 1 design. And the touchpad had MAJOR grounding issues and was unusable most of the time. The reliability was a big factor. So I returned it for the zenbook 14x which i have heard a lot of amazing things. The zenbook was a very amazing laptop aswell. It had speed and quality. However it wasnt dolby vision capable for my netflix movies so the quality of watching content dropped. It obviously was not a 2 in 1 1 which I started missing. However, the display was beautiful for scrolling through pages and such but the colors were hard to change to my liking. So I went back to the drawing board AGAIN. I started doing more research and was looking for a 4k oled laptop with the features i wanted and found that 4k is pointless at 14"". So I ran into LENOVO 9i 2.8k OLED on sale at my bestbuy.

This is the first time i have ever bought a samsung computer and i am so glad that i did. This laptop is SO thin and light- it practucally weighs nothing! The resolution is fantastic and the layout is easy to learn- this laptop has a samsung pen included that is awesome! I truely love everything about this laptop - i have been very cautious with it because i learned from the teviews that the screen cracks- i can see how that could be possible since it is so thin.

"First impression of the Laptop is that it is a workhorse, with plenty of ram and and SDD space.  The screen is crisp and sharp.  However, the system has its glitches and here are some.  1. The cam does not work for windows login purposes.  Not sure for the price paid - why this feature was totally missed by Samsung.  2. The system gets unusually hot when working on it for prolonged periods of time. 3. although the case looks ""sturdy"" it is actualy quite flimsy.  4. Fingerprint to login to windows keeps giving an error message.  MY calls to Microsoft on this issue all come down to the manufacturer Samsung and nothing to do with Windows.  So it gets two stars from me.",The person dont like that the camera doesnt work for Windows login purposes,0,0.0
"The Samsung - Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 15.6"" with AMOLED Touch Screen brings all the power you need from a PC tower, packed into a razor-thin Samsung-styled laptop.  Offering everything you need such as lightweight, thin profile, thin bezel, touch screen, Pen for tablet profile use, monster hard drive, powerful i7 processor from Intel, 16GB of speedy RAM, and more.I found this laptop to be a nice change of pace from the typical laptops from work and the bargain brands.  The Samsung Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 is the second iteration of this loved line and Samsung has done a fantastic job bringing the perfect balance of power and features to lightweight and portable.  I was most impressed with the i7 processor and its ability to keep up with everything I could throw at it... I use high graphic rendered games and crypto-mining to see what a computer can actually do...  Any computer can be used to write a paper or send email, but a true test of its abilities comes through something more grueling like cryptomining!PROS- Samsung/Galaxy brand, innovations, and reputation- Thin!- Powerful!- 2 in 1 style for laptop an tablet operations- S-pen included and works well for tablet mode- Long battery life- Quality higher-end componentsCONS- Cost is high compared to other brands, but you get what you pay for!",The person likes the i7 processor of this laptop to mine crypto-currency,0,0.0

"This Galaxy Book2 Pro 360 15.6"" screen is a beautiful looking laptop. It was purchased to replace our almost 10 year old 17"" touchscreen Dell that still looks brand new but is no longer supported because of windows 8.1. We treat our electronics correctly, and normally get years of use out of them. We have used numerous Samsung Galaxy phones and love them, including our latest S22 Ultra. (We traded in our Note 8 phones that were still pristine) After getting the Book2 home, and it being used sparingly while sitting on the table, we could see the crack on the screen all the way from the left to the right. The crack is almost invisible, mainly seen when looking from the top of the screen. The laptop starts up correctly and the screen looks bright and clear, except for the faint line from the crack. We do not know if the crack was there when we bought it, or if it cracked on opening the laptop to use it. Of course it is past the return window. And now after looking online, it appears this has happened often enough. As of now, the laptop is still usable, but we are afraid the screen will completely be unusable.

"Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 2 360 have a high quality build, very sturdy. Design is esthetically appealing and refined. Unbelievably lightweight! Processing power and responsiveness is incredible. The pen is a nice and welcomed edition to match with the flexibility of this PC. Definitely can expect a full day of use up to 12 hours, based on settings. Typing is good, about average, certainly comfortable and accurate. Monitor is bright and images really pop, color accuracy is well calibrated.Why 4 stars instead of 5, you ask? I deducted 1 star for battery life and not offering a 4K display. I have not experienced any issues with battery drain or wanting for a sharper image; it""s just that I expect both from a top product such as this. I researched and compared other high end models from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Apple. Comparable features and specs were either not matched or as in the case with Apple nearly double the cost. In the end this struck the right balance for my needs with portability (storage too) being very high on the list. Speaking of list, compare to any other and you will find it is top of the line latest features (Windows, Memory, Intel etc.)Again, I highly recommend and am very much pleased with Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 2 360.",The person likes the processing power and responsiveness of this laptop,0,0.0

"{'I have had the opportunity to test out this beastly beautiful monster of a laptop and it is truly remarkable. I have no qualms of it whatsoever. Technology really has come a long way over the past 10-15 years.Speed has always been a big factor for me. I would always upgrade old laptops with SSDs and it would instantly add new life for a few years to that machine. But nothing beats a fresh and new laptop!Processing speed is always preferred to keep up with all the tasks that I do such as photo and video editing, and even playing games, and this can actually keep up to my surprise. The screen flipping is nice and tablet mode is truly a nice luxury. the AMOLED screen quality is very reminiscent of any portable OLED screen you can think of, but better. It""s so clean, I can stare at it all day :D it""s really good for the eyes. I can view really small text with ease.I don""t really understand wifi 6E capabliities but I feel the speed as pretty fast. I do have gigabit internet so that may help.The battery life on this thing is truly amazing. Even though it promises up to 21 hours, I can reliably go on a plane ride and trip for 8  hours with heavy usage and not have to worry about the battery dying.The thing I am disappointed with is the sound, but I shouldn""t expect super amazing speakers when that""s not what this specializes in.Overall, for the price, a super solid device and product that I would recommend to anyone.'}",The person likes to work on some projects with this laptop,1,0.91

I have not used it an excessive amount since purchase, but everything seems to be running well. I can have multiple tabs open at a time, and everything loads fairly quick. I have not tried using the laptop in different positions other than flat on my desk but am excited to do so. The screen is bright and vibrant, keyboard and mousepad work well. One of my favorite things is probably the pen that came with the laptop. I love being able to use the touchscreen feature without getting fingerprints all over the screen. A few cons I have noticed is: 1.) how loud the cooling system is. I will be using this computer in college, and it may get annoying to classmates in close proximity when the cooling system kicks on (and this seems to be pretty often if I am using the computer very actively i.e. many open tabs, working on a google doc, etc.).2.) The laptop keeps disconnecting to the internet. This could possibly be due to not living in an area that has the best internet connection, but it is happening a bit excessively. I don""t think it should be happening as much as it is, especially when I am the only person using the internet when it occurs.3.) This is partially due to me not paying close enough attention, but there are no usb ports. I will now have to buy an adapter. I guess this may not be such a deal breaker to some, but I am not excited to have to spend extra money to buy and adapter when, in my opinion, the laptop should have come with at least one usb port.Overall, the laptop is working well. This is mainly just my first impression. I will need to use it more to get a better understanding and opinion toward the computer.

It""s currently in the process of being repaired.The screen is what really made me mad. With all my care in handling my computer and even putting it in a case in my backpack, I opened my computer one day to a long hairline crack through the screen. Again, this was only 2-3 months into having the computer. Soon after, another showed up. It""s still usable, but it""s incredibly frustrating that, with all the gentleness with which I""ve handled my computer, a crack like this still shows up, and Samsung considers it a ""physical damage"" and not poor design/manufacturer""s defect, so they won""t repair the screen for free. I did nothing to cause the cracks other than simply carry it like I would any other computer, except a little more carefully.All in all, the insides work well (besides the broken USB-C port) and it""s a solid computer.

"{'I have been using this Galaxybook for more than a month now. It was bought to replace an old HP laptop I had since 2017, and is a major improvement based on that comparison alone. When purchasing a new laptop, I was looking for one that could keep up with my office work and be good for travel.Here is what I like about the laptop:-Very lightweight and efficient design; I can carry it around the house and in my tote without it feeling like a burden.-Fast performance: when opening multiple browser windows or doing streaming, there is no lag at all. This laptop keeps up no matter what you""re doing (for gaming maybe consider another choice but is above average performance).-Storage (1TB): my old laptop had 1 TB storage and as someone who likes to store lots of files and photos, I wanted a laptop with lots of storage to give me this capacity. Coupled with this plus the above pros, this was a solid choice for me.-Extra Points (S Pen/Tablet conversion): At first I didn""t know what to do with the S Pen so I didn""t really incorporate it at all in my work. However, when I didn""t have a wireless mouse nearby, the pen was very useful for me to navigate things on the display if I found the keypad tiring. I also find the tablet-convertible feature to be interesting, but haven""t used it too often when at home. But I can see myself doing the screen flip when on a plane, so this feature is still useful long-run.Now what I don""t like about this laptop, but wasn""t a huge deal-breaker for me:-Only USB-C ports, no USB-A or HDMI: I knew what I was getting myself into when purchasing this laptop, but I wish it would have at least a USB-A. Anyway, I had to factor in the cost and time it took for me to find a docking station with a USB-C cable as I didn""t have one before.-Battery Life is not super ""long-lasting"" as advertised: sure this laptop""s battery is way better than my old one, but I thought that charging it 1x to full battery would last me a full day on heavy workloads. May depend on what I""m viewing at the time, but I feel it only lasts max 5-6 hours in a day. Could last up to 2-3 days max when only using the laptop through short sessions throughout the day.-Delicate screen: saw some reviews mention this, but yes since this is a thin screen it""s hard for me to be rough with this laptop. I am being cautious in opening and closing this baby, but if I were to slip up, then it would probably break (I hope not).-$$$ price: Bought this when it was on sale for $400 off its original $1600  price tag. Had personally saved up for a really nice PC, but for laptops that can do the ""job"" then maybe it""s not this Galaxybook as I could have gone for one less expensive. The price will decline anyway over time, but important to think about if you""re on a budget.'}",The person likes to work on some projects with this laptop,1,0.1

"{'I have had a Surface Pro 3 since 2014. It still works great but I need more RAM to operate my website for my small business. I also got sick of having to plug in an extension to use my num pad and wanted a larger screen. I use the touch screen often as well so that was a must for me. That""s how I landed on this laptop. It was beautiful, sleek, and it was on sale. Having read the reviews, I swore there was no way I""d crack the screen because I take extra care of my devices. I know lots of folks don""t do that so I figured that couldn""t possibly be me. I was wrong! My screen cracked the third week in. I would let it soft close every time I put it away and one day, I heard this crunch. I opened the laptop to check if I closed it on something (my sister had recently closed her laptop on a peanut) but nothing was there...only a hairline crack from the left middle top area across to the right mid-top. I assume this crack may be from opening and closing somehow because I tend to use the left side to lift the screen. It""s the only explanation I have. I have never ever broken or cracked a phone, tablet, or laptop in all my 40 years. I have been very careful with this laptop because of the reviews. I have my Surface Pro 3 since 2014 and have had a number of cats jump down onto it with no broken screen. This laptop can crack with the slightest movement. I tried to use the warranty and they refused. I have BestBuy Total Care and they still wanted me to pay $100 to have it fixed. I was appalled. Why charge so much for a laptop that is that delicate if WE, the consumer, have to pay to have it fixed when it""s barely been removed from the packaging!!!?!! The tech guy at Best Buy pointed out that it is just the external part of the screen, with no damage to screen function, so he suggested I don""t have it fixed and save my money. He didnt seem to understand why I was so upset. It""s the principal of it all. I""ve had other laptops for over ten years that still function perfectly, albeit slow, and I""m supposed to be okay with this?! NO. I looked for another laptop that would suit my needs and nothing else would cut it, at least not at Best Buy where I have credit, so I just kept it. Thankfully, there""s still no damage to the light up part or touch screen. I haven""t seen anyone being transparent about possible reasons or actions that did or could have caused the problems with the screen. I""m probably too transparent and I figure that it doesn""t matter if I omit the reason, Samsung won""t repair the screen anyway so why omit it.... Month three a second crack parallel to the first showed up. I assume the second crack may have happened from one of the 3lb kittens I rescued walking across the top of the laptop before I put it up. I""ve been religious about ensuring I put it away, even choosing not to do more work for fear of breaking it more, which is ridiculous, I know. I""m not sure if that is what happened but it""s my best guess unless it really is from opening from one side.Month 6 there is another small crack connecting the two cracks at the top of the screen. I really think the issue is the super slim screen that flexes when it shouldn""t. If you don""t open and close your laptop a lot, you might be okay, but I have interruptions quite often during my day and to protect my laptop, I close it and put it in my desk, so it doesn""t get walked on. I""m starting to think it would be smarter to leave it open and sitting out rather than closing it. Who knows. You shouldn""t have to worry about this issue this much. Laptops are NOT supposed to be this delicate. The whole point of a laptop is portability and durability. I expect more for the price of this laptop. The screen is definitely NOT durable.I have travelled with it from Texas to New York and it did quite well. No problems there but I already had a crack. When I pick it up and carry it by itself, I can hear this crackling sound...it makes me cringe because I know it""s the screen and fear that looking at it wrong could upset it and crack this thing! I assume it""s because there is not a hinge in the middle of the screen where most folks would grab it. It""s truly a design flaw and Samsung won""t own up to their mistake. While I understand that a cat walking over your laptop can cause damage and that is on me, there""s no reason it should be so delicate that a kitten would cause damage. There""s also no excuse that simply opening or carrying it would cause damage. It""s preposterous!Outside of the screen, there have been a lot of errors and restarts but I don""t know if it""s related or not. It freezes at times and if you rotate the screen to work, when you try to rotate it back, it freezes. The 360 mode is worthless if you are using it interchangeably for work rather than a movie or something related. Also, if you do zoom calls or something of the sort, the video is not so great but considering my last one was 2014, it is much better. Again, for this price, the video should be a lot better.I really needed a laptop with a num pad and was sick of dealing with the folding of my keyboard of my surface when working from my lap. Touch screen was also a must as I use it just as much as the mouse and keyboard. Problem is, they messed up the num pad by switching the 0 and the period so there""s a lot of corrections I have to make if I am not careful. I can work around that, and while one can say that at least the screen isn""t fully damaged blah blah...it""s still a pain and should not have happened. As for the errors, it does a great job of correcting itself, minus the need to restart when you rotate the screen, it tried to fix itself and I have waited for it for a long time and tried to help it without forcing it to restart but no dice. Whatever other errors are going on, I don""t understand why. It""s always something that has to do with the system and I haven""t changed or added anything...so it aint me. Outside of all of that, I havent returned it because it hasn""t exactly slowed me down. It fixes itself, restarts quickly, and all is pretty good. I like the sound. It connects to my bluetooth headphones, and runs mostly pretty darn smooth. It has seemed pretty hot when I use my fancy fifine microphone to edit youtube videos and tends to keep a decent charge while running a lot of RAM heavy applications.Do with this information what you will...I love this laptop for many reasons but Samsung should do something about the screen.'}",The person likes to work on this laptop,1,0.1

My most pleasant surprise is the 15,6 amoled display,  It is absolutely stunning for a full HD resolution. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference from a 4k display.  When I consider  purchasing any laptop, the quality of the audio is a deal breaker for me. I travel a lot and like the conveince of listening  to music through the external  speakers.   The audio is loud and clear, with lows and midrange perfectly balanced for a very full and rich sound.  The Wacom pen technology is a treat for artists, providing one of the best drawing and note taking experinces I have ever had.  The 2-1, 360 viewing option is icing on the cake.  Due to its very light form factor you can  enjoy watching videos in tent mode, movie mode, or as a tablet, without  the weight feeling clumsy and awkward. Not to mension the long lasting battery for a worry free full day of use.

"{'Recently had a terrible experience with Samsung that makes me question if I will continue to buy its products. More specifically, I bought an earlier model (NP950QDB-KB1US) Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 15"" approximately 2 years ago and had no issues until about a month ago when it forced a BIOS update on the computer.The screen froze during the update showing no progress for over a day. I forced shut off and was unable to restart. The screen stayed black, but I had the blinking blue light and the keyboard backlight show signs of life.I literally viewed and tried every suggested fix provided by Samsung support to no avail. The laptop was out of warranty, but I was fine sending the laptop for a repair estimate as a hopeful next step. Basically, the repair was a motherboard replacement with a charge of $867 bucks! I politely requested the rep to see if Samsung could offer me a discount given that the I barely had the laptop 2 years and the issue appeared to be caused by a Samsung update.Long story short - no discount, no ability to speak with a manager, no nothing. I""m buying a new laptop in 2 years after spending quality bucks on a top line Samsung product. I now am worried about all of my other Samsung products (TVs, tablets, phones, etc.). Probably will be a while before I spend serious money with Samsung.If your high-priced product is a day out of warranty, please beware!'}",The user bought a new laptop to replace the old one after its screen froze,1,0.0

The OLED screen is absolutely gorgeous and really spoils you when it comes to other screens. Overall this things is amazing and I love it. Sometimes I even use it over my desktop just for the simplicity. My only quips pertaining to this model from bestbuy is the non-upgradable ram. You can only get the 16gb version here which is decent enough to get stuff done and game but I wouldn""t suggest having many tabs open or programs open in the background. Main reason I got it here was that it was on a good sale compared to the Lenovo website. My other quip isn""t related to this version here on bestbuy but rather with the laptop itself, and that would have to be with the battery. This thing doesn""t last long. I know it""s a small laptop but even with power saver on and using silent mode I get maybe 3-4hrs of battery. Kinda sad about that but it works well enough for what I need it for.

"{'Have been eyeing this laptop every since it came out last year, has amazing reviews and decided to grab when it dropped to $1100. It does not disappoint. It is, well built and sturdy, has amazing performance, quiet, and a Small form factor. As a college student this laptop has been great. It doesn""t have the usual gamer look, but it still catches some attention.Performance: Haven""t tested more demanding games, but so far its dead quiet running Rocket League at 240fps. However, when I tested Cities Skylines 2 the fans do get really loud, performance seemed just about is expected of a Ryzen 7000Screen: Its a great screen. OLED, 120Hz, and really bright. My only complaint is the glossy finish.Sound: In quiet mode it is really quiet, but when in performance mode, it gets really, really loud. I could hear it from across another room.Keyboard: It is a shame it doesnt atleast have per zone RGB at this price point, but It doesn""t ruin the asthetic at all. The typing experience felt a lot better compared to my previous laptop (HP OMEN 16), especially the mousepad. The mousepad feels amazing. Quality: When it comes to quality this thing is a tank. The overall finish, and built quality of the chassis feels premium. The best part to me was the screen barely wobbles, and it doesnt seem to be a fingerprint magnet. Overall, it feels really solid. Battery: This was the main reason why I bought this laptop, the battery is really good. In quiet mode, 60hz, full keyboard backlight, and screen slightly dimmed, I get around 4 to 6 hours, depending on the workload. I have seen other users get around 8 hours though on video playback.Some notes which I believe are not mentioned:- GPU is 105W- I believe the RAM is soldered, so no upgradability there.- Speakers are average at best, but I always use headphones so not a problem for me- 100W USB C charging- No ethernet port- Has a fingerprint reader'}",,1,0.89
"{'I""m planning on moving abroad in a couple months and wanted a laptop to replace my tower and give myself a bit more mobile setup.

"{'Since this competes in the same space with the Asus Zephyrus G14 2023 (price and performance), I""m going to draw comparisons to that device when reviewing this Legion Slim 5.First things first, this is a gaming laptop and a 14.5"" one at that; so expect temps in the low to high 90s and loud fans under heavy load or when gaming. Even though this laptop does not have liquid metal for cooling like the G14, it does use PTM7950. Despite what would seem to be difference in levels when it comes cooling superiority...this laptop runs cooler and have a less high pitched fan noise. In fact, this laptop performs better because of it. In smaller machines, how good your cooling is will either hurt or boost performance; and this Legion has got it handled well despite having a supposedly weaker CPU.The screen: It""s OLED. There is nothing new I can say when it comes to this type of screen""s color accuracy. It is a joy to game and consume content on it. It sadly, does not have g-sync; which may or may not be a deal breaker for some. Not to me though.The keyboard is the standard Legion laptop quality. They are slightly larger than the 2023 G14, but share the same feel and pressure needed to active them. Touchpad is smaller, but it does the job. Nothing to write home about, but it""s good enough that you won""t always wish to have a mouse with you.Speakers are decent. It lacks bass, but at least the mids and highs are well separated. Macbooks still reign supreme when it comes to laptop speakers.For the internals. It has room for 2 m.2 SSDs. Good for a main boot drive and a dedicated Steam library or if you want to have Linux on a sperate drive instead of partitioning 1 drive. This laptop has soldered RAM, which is already a deal breaker since some games are already wanting more than 16 GB of the stuff. But the trade off is that it consumes less power and is much faster.Exterior. Metal top lid and bottom plate. Plastic deck, but its the study good stuff like you see in the Lenovo P-series laptops. All in all, it is a great addition to the 14"" gaming laptop options.

"{'Incredible laptop. I been using this laptop nonstop from a month now and it^s better than expected. Watched a lot of reviews about it saying that it was their favorite 14 laptop from 2023 at msrp so being able to grab it on sale was the cherry on top. Comming from a 14 asus laptop that at least in my experience was always so hot and underperforming compared to this one (even tho it has little bit better cpu specs, same gpu and ram), returning the other one and buying this one was the best decision. OLED screen flawless, double the m.2 storage than the ASUS (plus double write and read speeds too) and amazing build quality. Weight is also really good, around, super easy to carry and the fact that the brick is on the smaller side considering is 170 Watts, is one more thing to consider to buy it. In my opinion really good keyboard, comfortable to type long hours in it, also good for gaming and the fact that it stays nice to the touch after a long gaming session (especially compared to my previous laptop) is a big plus.  The fingerprint reader is definitely a nice addition, super fast also, I use it instead of a pin and work as intended. The only thing that I could think could be better is the battery, around 7:30 hours on quiet mode and with the proper configuration doing light work and browsing and around 2 hours of gaming AAA titles, but in all honesty, considering the size of the battery (73wh) and that the 4060 actually uses 105 w, is more than enough in my opinion.

"{'I have looked far and wide for a portable gaming laptop, this one has finally fit the bill, after using it for a bit, here are my thoughts:Size: It is not as light or small as other 14"" laptops, it does not fit a 14"" Samsonite laptop bag I had, just barely.  But, it is much lighter than traditional laptops, it is still very much compact and light to carry, charger size is reasonable, and if you don""t need its high performance, you can use a 100w PD USB-C charger.Screen: The one common thread in what people say about this laptop, is how beautiful the display is, and I will repeat that, amazingly nice to look at content, gaming, web or otherwise, quite bright enough and colors are amazing, 120hz is a great touch too.Body: I personally am a fan of the more ""serious"" look of the machine, it will easily fit in a classroom or workplace without raising any eyebrows, I am a fan of the white LED keyboard, it""s build quality is great, gives me some ThinkPad vibes.Performance: A high performing AMD CPU with an RTX 4060 with a 105w TDP, though in normal use it typically hovers in the 70-80w range in standard/auto mode, the high res display does make hitting the 120hz refresh not as simple, but doable.Heat/Noise: This to me is an important part, and this laptop passes with flying colors.  Naturally, in turbo mode, it will get hot and loud.  But, in the normal mode, it is quite well behaved, noise levels and temps being very fair for the fact it is a 14"" laptop, included is a pic showing typical use temps in Cyberpunk.  In silent mode you loose some performance but it gets very quiet, great!Final notes: It has a full size SD card slot, useful when I want to transfer photos, has no thunderbolt which is a big bummer and perhaps its biggest weakness is the lack of expandable ram, stuck at 16gb.  It does have one M.2 slot for extra storage though.  At the sale price of $1050 that I got it for, I am a very happy customer and would recommend this laptop for anyone who is looking for not a laptop that feels good to use, but also is amazing to look at, I rather have lower frames 60-120hz and an amazing high resolution OLED to a standard FHD 240hz panel, but this comes down to personal preference.'}",The person likes to work on some projects with this laptop,1,0.92

"{'As for the seller, they were great. Everything went smooth and the order arrived on time without issue.As for the product... There""s no arguing that Apple makes a solid computer with a steady and consistent OS, but their underlying anti-consumer market strategy and general spirit of pretentiousness make me cringe a bit when buying, or considering to buy one of their products. That being said, while the price is a bit high, the MacBook is still a good machine.Just be aware that this laptop only comes equipped with 2 usb type-c ports and a headphone jack. I think they could have easily added at least 2 more of these ports; especially since there are no standard usb ports, but that""s par for the course when it comes to Apple""s current offerings. This means that for any traditional storage device including sd, micro sd, USB drives, etc., you will need a peripheral adapter device, sold separately of course, in order to use them. Also true for any other device/ peripheral (such as a wireless mouse or keyboard dongle) that doesn""t directly connect via type-c usb.All in all, the MacBook is light, slim, and easy to carry, making it convenient for on-the-go work or study. And if you can""t live without the mac OS, this is the way to go. However, just be aware that there are more affordable windows-based machines on the market that match and even exceed the power and portability of the MacBook series of laptops.

I""m not a creator, I do research, write scientific papers, not a gamer and the 8GB is plenty for my purposes, and the 512GB is sufficient storage.  This laptop is fast as lightning, great touchpad, and only slightly heavier than a MacBook Air with a fan cooling system, it never runs hot when I am working 8-10 hours a day.  In my opinion, it""s a few dollars more than the Air, but it""s a 1st class laptop and the extra ports and MagSafe power connector is just a great bonus.

I was able to completely and totally max out the graphics settings at high resolutions for all the games I play - and it looked and performed stunningly.I also use this laptop for work and do design work using AutoCAD and the performance with that is outstanding. Having the separate numeric keyboard is a big plus, as is the large SSD and ample RAM. The display is also well suited, and I often also attach a large 4k monitor via HDMI and that also works perfectly.I was a bit surprised by the size and weight of the external power supply. It seems almost as big and heavy as the laptop itself. Not a big deal since this is in no way billed as an ultra portable machine, plus it is probably the most robustly constructed power supply I have ever seen with a laptop. The cord is thick and sturdy, as are the power connector at the laptop end of the cable.The keyboard is nice and easy to read, and the lighting effects are easy to configure, When using the arrow keys to move my character in games instead of the letter keys I did sometimes brush across the touchpad which created unpredictable results.Overall this is a well-built, high-performance laptop with a great screen and a reasonable price.'}",The person uses the product to study in an environment similar to that at school or college,1,0.91
"{'This laptop is the complete package with a top tier Intel Core i7 processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics chipset. Upon first boot out the box to being in windows was roughly 15 minutes. Then a few updates and uninstalls of useless apps and ready to rock. Online speed is super fast when connected to my WiFi 6 network so downloading updates and games was quick and painless. Downloaded a few different games that I enjoy such as Battlefield 2042 and Star Wars Squadrons. Both those games ran smooth with no ghosting or glitching with the 165Hz screen and Nvidia GPU.Also ran a few tests with 3D Mark to push the laptop to its limits and see how well it performed. Overall put up some decent scores as you can see in the screenshots from a few different tests that I was able to run. This laptop has the hardware to run just about any game with high quality settings. Keyboard layout is nice and the Predator software and built in button allow you to quickly change the settings to boost performance and enhance cooling when gaming. One complaint which I have had with just about any gaming laptop is the battery life when not plugged in. At most I would say you will probably only get about 3 to 3 1/2 hours of gametime or watching movies even with the monitor brightness turned down and in eco mode. Also like the standard 10-Key number pad layout and the built in Predator button to quickly launch the Predator Sense application. This is no small laptop and you can feel the quality that this laptop offers and with that it isn""t the most portable but it has all the power necessary to run the latest games on the go.'}",The person likes to play games on this laptop,1,0.1
"{'Acer - Predator Helios Neo 16"" WQXGA (2560 X 1600) 165Hz IPS Gaming Laptop - Intel i7-13700HX (13th Gen)  16GB RAM DDR5, GeForce RTX 4060 with 8GB DDR6  1TB SSDCompared to some of the other gaming laptops I""ve had, this one arrived in more non-descript packaging, but the laptop itself is quite attractive. It""s charcoal grey with the Predator emblem on the lid and on the lower bezel of the screen. It""s understated and sleek - I really like its looks.Not for the faint of heart, this laptop weighs about 5.7 lbs without the power supply, which is beefy and heavy itself (you can understand why since it develops 300 watts). While this wouldn""t be the laptop you""d throw in your bag for typical classes at school, it is the laptop you""d want with you if you game, do VR work, do CAD work or edit music/photo/video material. As you can see from the specs in the first paragraph, it""s designed for some serious work or play.When I received this one, I loaded up Steam and then 7 Days To Die as well as Icarus, games that are demanding in their own right. There were no hiccups of any kind. They both ran flawlessly. Since I have mine set up to operate at 60 FPS, that is what it did in both games. It didn""t vary more than 1 or 2 FPS at any time from that. I have no doubt that if I set it up differently, the FPS would bounce from 60 FPS up to the refresh rate of whatever display was being used. I have my Predator set up on my desk with a USB-C dock attached as well as my 27"" primary external monitor running off the HDMI port and my 32"" external monitor running off one of the USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports. My wired mouse runs off the USB-C dock, along with other items, and my external keyboard is wireless. In addition, I have my external Samsung T7 (1TB) SSD running off the left USB-A port. The two USB-A ports on the right, one of which is PD, are unused but available for a headset or other peripherals. Anyway, with browsers and other programs running, my games are unaffected and run full out and as smooth as can be. One oddity, with my previous laptop my Samsung T7 SSD would be recognized while plugged into my USB-C dock. With my Predator, the T7 SSD will receive power as usual from the dock, but the Predator will not allow the T7 to show under This PC in File Explorer. It recognizes it just fine if I hook it up to any of the USB-A ports, but for some reason, it won""t if it""s plugged into my USB-C dock. PREDATORSENSE has a dedicated key just above the number pad to the right of the keyboard. When pressed, it calls up a utility that allows you to adjust the backlighting and 4-zone RGB keyboard lighting to suit you. You may also set your fans for Auto, Max or use a custom setting. You can also chose the modes of gaming performance here: Quiet, Balanced, Performance, and Turbo, which overclocks and maxes your fans all at the same time.The MODE  Hotkey located above and to the left of the keyboard allows you  to set the performance of your laptop without going into Predatorsense. Using this key you can set it to Quiet, Balanced, Performance, and Turbo by just bumping the Mode button.Predator Helios Neo uses all-metal metal fan technology as well as Liquid Metal thermal grease. All in all, during my use I never saw the temperature of the hardware exceed recommended allowances. Except for all-out gaming, the temperatures fall well below built-in limitations and even in full-out mode it doesn""t pose a problem.The track-pad works very well with good tap sensitivity. It""s made of Gorilla Glass, but it is not as slick-finished as Apple""s or Alienware""s track-pads. It has a full sized keyboard including number pad. Very comfortable typing, Good tactile feel from keys.It is equipped with its own Killer E2600 Ethernet port and Killer WiFi 6 AX1650. It also has a microSD card reader.It has 2 stereo speakers located on the left and right lower sides toward the track-pad. I have to say that the sound volume is not really loud maxed out. I""ve had other laptops that were louder when the volume was cranked up. You can hear what""s playing OK, but you""ll be closer to 90 on the volume scale than 50. This would be my one real negative of this laptop. Of course, the built in speaker volume would only be a problem if everything was maxed out performance wise, but that""s what headphones are made for!It offers a webcam FHD (1920x1080) and 1080 HD Video, but there is no Windows Hello or fingerprint scanner.It had the following ports: Two - USB-C /Thurderbolt 4, three - USB-A 3.2 (one is PD) ports, one HDMI port, charging port, Headphone/Speaker port, Ethernet port, and Kensington lock slot, and, of course, the microSD card reader.It has a 16"" IPS G-SYNC display, 165 Hz, 16:10 aspect ratio (taller than 16:9 so more room for documents) that I really like. 500 nits brightness! Good color dynamics as well. Resolution is wonderful with the 2560x1600 display. Display bezels are narrow so the lid doesn""t extend much past the screen itself.It comes with 1TB NvMe SSD but there""s another slot available for another SSD. You can put, I believe, up to 2TB in each slot. It comes with 16GB RAM upgradable to 32 RAM.All together, I""d say Acer has a very good entry in this price range of gaming laptops. It""s solidly made, attractive, with a lot of bells and whistles along with some very serious hardware for those needing serious muscle for their work or play. Their attention to the cooling system will help ensure the Predator should perform very well into the future.'}",The person likes that this laptop is lightweight and easy to carry around,1,0.74
"{'The Acer Predator is great gaming laptop, even when playing AAA titles at 2560x1600.  Everything I threw at it, it played perfectly.  After throwing some upgrades in it, it became even better (more on that below).For portability, 16 inch screen is my maximum I""ll go.  Any bigger becomes a hindrance and won""t fit in my backpack.  It does come with a case, but it""s more for scratch protection imho and won""t do much if to save the laptop if you drop it.  Depending on how portable you need it, be warned, it is a big boy and the power brick is massive.  It fits in my motorcycle backpack, but I don""t think a standard student backpack will work (though I could be wrong).  For performance, I was happy with the Predator right out of the box.  Shadow of the Tomb Raider on High netted me over 110 FPS.  Diablo 4 on Ultra was 120 .  Everything else was buttery smooth and looked great.  The performance went up after I decided that 16gb of RAM wasn""t enough so I bought a 32gb kit and also threw in another NVMe (2tb Samsung).  Upgrading, if your semi-tech savvy and not scared of prying, is super simple.  Props to Acer for making it user friendly.  I can""t stand non-upgradable and soldered down parts.I normally don""t say laptops and PCs are on equal footing, but the performance of the Predator was very close in FPS to my AMD desktop (5800X) with a 3070 FE.  I find myself to use the laptop more than that PC when I am in the room so that says a lot.  Noise level is pretty minimal, but once the fans kick in, it""s as loud as a mini jet engine.  With headphones, you won""t even notice.  Great performance to price ratio.  Can definitely be a PC replacement using a docking station or the built in video out.  Acer did a good job keeping the bloatware to a minimum and not integrated into Windows 11, so it can be easily removed.  I would recommend the Helios as a top choice for people in the market for laptops.'}",The person likes to work on some projects with this laptop,1,0.1
"{'The Acer Predator Helios Neo is a solid device with lots of power, but it lacks some premium features.First, this laptop has a ton of ports.I count 3 USB-A ports, a micro-SD card reader, a headphone jack, an Ethernet port, 2 USB-C ports, and a full-size HDMI port. My only complaint about the ports is that the HDMI ports and USB-C ports are awkwardly placed on the back of the device.This laptop does not support Windows Hello sign-in options. You won""t be able to use your facial recognition or your fingerprint to login. These are premium features that I""ve gotten accustomed to on my previous devices, and I""m feeling their absence here.The keyboard lighting is broken up into 4 zones and has a handful of options in terms of behaviors. It""s comfortable enough to type on, but I wasn""t terribly impressed by it.The number pad is finicky. It wasn""t until I""d updated the computer a few times that it consistently worked after each reboot without hitting the number lock key.The keyboard deck itself is plastic, but it feels pretty solid. I didn""t experience much in the way of keyboard flex.I was disappointed by the speakers. They didn""t get terribly loud, and they felt rather ""anemic"" for lack of a better term.The laptop is fairly chunky, and the power brick is enormous. I was surprised by just how heavy this laptop was.As a whole, the laptop doesn""t have much of a ""gamer aesthetic."" Aside from some angular lines along the rear of the laptop, and the multi-color keyboard backlighting, there isn""t much to call this out as a gaming laptop. If you""re looking for something more ""subdued,"" then this would probably be the laptop for you.In terms of power, this laptop didn""t have any issues tackling anything that I threw at it.All of my games booted up quickly and ran just fine. The 1TB hard drive is more than adequate for me to fit a good assortment of games on.The laptop did come with some bloatware that I had to clear off. I would recommend keeping the ""Predator Sense"" app though as it allows you to control the keyboard backlighting as well as some other behaviors.This is a very capable laptop. It""s not terribly showy, but it has more than enough power to get the job done.'}",The user has a hard time hearing the person on the other side of the laptop due to the laptop speakers,1,0.0

"{'Looking at other similar systems, this one was the best because of the features and quality I was looking for. It""s got the graphics, speed, and processing power needed for my projects and gaming. It runs like a charm. The 10-key pad is a plus, as the others I looked at didn""t have it.There a few cons for me personally, but these don""t take away from the overall experience:1) The keys aren""t in the same orientation as on the Acer Nitro 5. Had to get used to the new placement and use of the functions.2) There""s no place for a standard 2.5"" drive. Which would""ve been easier to transfer my data, as all I would have had to do was transfer the drive itself instead of copying everything over.3) There are no easy access panels for the RAM or SSD, you have to completely remove the bottom panel to access them, which was a chore to do as the clips did not want to budge at first, but with a bit of careful perseverance, it finally relented (with no broken pieces, thankfully).Replacing the RAM is easy once you actually get the panel off. It also does have a space for a second SSD (PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 2280), which I highly recommend, especially if you""re a digital hoarder like me.Other than those cons, which as I stated doesn""t detract from the overall experience, this system is amazing.One thing I also noticed is in one question about the RAM, Acer stated it could use up to 64GB. While that might be true for another model, the *official* supported RAM is 32GB, which is what I have installed.The RTX 4060 is powerful and runs games beautifully. I""ve been playing The Talos Principle and TTP2 along with a few other games here and there, and it handles them perfectly.With the i7-13700, running programs is a breeze. Just open and go. The only waiting period is if a program has to load assets, but even that only takes seconds at the most.It""s great for video editing and processing. Maybe not top tier, but definitely up to the task. It can run the latest Adobe, Microsoft, and other software suites, whatever your preference is.It did come with Windows 11 Home, which I never really much cared for Win 11 having seen it before and using it at work. Though there are programs that can make it feel and look more like Windows 10, which I have done, making it more familiar.The battery only lasts a couple hours on normal use, way less when watching videos or gaming, but given the hardware, it""s no surprise. Would""ve been nice if they used a higher-rated battery, but it""s a small sacrifice for the beast this thing is.The laptop is a bit on the weighty side at 6 pounds, but with the components put into it, it""s worth it.So overall, it""s a great system, no real complaints, just a few minor personal cons.Highly recommend for a higher mid-range laptop.'}",The person likes to teach with this laptop,1,1.0

"{'It""s a great windows 11 laptop. Everything reacts fast, considering windows11s general lagginess. It has 2 ddr4 sodimm ram slots plus an extra slot for a second nvme, although a sturdy cord goes on top of it, so not sure how it would fit.I do video editing and sure enough 16gb of ram are barely usable. It told me I ran out of ram to open photoshop while in premiere pro.4k and plus editing with h264 and h265 is pretty undoable from the internal ssd. Timeline stutters after a few seconds of playing. Pretty disappointing for a cpu and gpu that both are supposed to have hardware encoders for these two formats. Exporting is fast after changing settings up in nvidia control to force premiere to use the gpu. Otherwise it uses the gpu of the 13700hx, which is slow. Won""t utilize both cards like adobe states it would.For photoshop on the other hand you need to disable nvidia gpu because it""s extremely sluggish with nvidia gpu. Can""t even draw a box without stuttering.Even the 64gb ram upgrade I made didn""t change that. It just let""s me open everything at the same time. I see ram usage up to 40gb using premiere.Other than that, I like the option to switch power modes with a single button. I""d never use max performance mode though. It""s so loud, I can hear the fans through a closed door. So it""ll probably never run on maximum performance because of the noise. It blasts out enough heat to warm up your room after a while. My m1 max macbook is definitely quiet and outperforms this laptop in editing. I just like windows better and need it for software that doesn""t exist on mac. Kind of disappointed that my mac from 2021 edits smoother than this machine, but happy that it outperforms my ryzen 2700x full tower. I won""t be needing a big tower computer in my room anymore.It""s all in all a great windows laptop, just upgrade the ram right away unless you don""t do content creation.Coming from a mac display, this one feels weak but it""s not bad at all. After adjusting it with a colomiter it barely changed anything so it""s well adjusted right out the box.One time I accidentally pulled the power plug and the laptop slowed down immediately and would lock both performance modes from being selectable.

As far as pros go, the screen is bright and sharp, the GPU and CPU work really well, it""s a powerful laptop. Acer made these laptops to be upgradeable so upgrading the ram and SSD are as easy as taking a few screws off and popping in your new hardware. As for cons, the battery life isn""t the best BUT it""s a beast when it comes to gaming so the power consumption comes with that, if you""re not gaming you can easily change the settings to where the battery life can lost longer (perhaps 4 MAYBE 5 hours of light office work) when gaming without being plugged in I say 2 hours. Speakers out of the box are trash but you can mess with the settings to make them sound way better. I purchased this laptop on sale for $1,079 pre tax and it is worth it at around that price.

Whether you""re running resource-intensive applications or working on several projects simultaneously, this laptop delivers seamless performance without any noticeable lag. The 512GB SSD provides ample storage space and ensures fast boot times and quick file transfers.The inclusion of the Lenovo Active Pen adds to the versatility of this device. With precise pressure sensitivity and palm-rejection technology, the pen allows for effortless drawing, note-taking, and creative work. It""s a great tool for artists, designers, and anyone who prefers the tactile experience of writing and drawing on a screen.Design-wise, the Yoga 9i is sleek and stylish. The ""Oatmeal"" color option gives it an elegant and sophisticated look. The 2-in-1 functionality allows you to use the laptop in various modes, including laptop, tent, stand, and tablet modes, providing flexibility for different tasks and settings.The keyboard is comfortable to type on, with well-spaced keys and good key travel.

The Thunderbolt 4 ports provide fast data transfer speeds and the ability to connect to multiple external displays.One minor drawback worth mentioning is the battery life.

In addition, I like the slightly larger screen size on this new iMac (24"" va 21""), without the computer that much bigger (the bezel is smaller). The downsides to this new iMac include the lack of USB-A ports, as I have a few printers (laser and label )that work with USB-A and only having two USB-C ports.

"{'Dell Inspiron 24 Touchscreen All-In-One desktop is a very convenient option for our family computing needs.  We wanted to have one for our workstation in Kitchen for kids to access and for browsing kitchen recipes, watching YouTube videos and were looking for a capable and versatile system and this specification matched all our requirements.Unboxing:  It comes with boxes with keyboard, mouse, stand for monitor/system and power supply.  Just unbox and install the stand, connect the power supply and turn it on for setup.Performance:  AMD Ryzen 5 7530U processor is a mid-range option with multitasking capabilities with 6 cores/12-way processing and provides smooth performance for most day-to-day simple tasks, like web browsing, watching YouTube/multimedia videos, social media accessing and so on.  It may not be good for gaming that requires high end processors, this is good enough for our use cases/scenarios for our kitchen workstation.  Comes with Windows 11 operating system as preinstalled.  Display:  Comes with 23.8 Full HD 10-point multitouch screen with 1920 x 1080 resolution offers an interactive and immersive color and clarity.  Touchscreen navigation is smooth when accessing menus and interacting with applications. Touchscreen adds versatility and ease of use with Windows 11. You have a big tablet on the countertop. The compact design integrates the computer components into the monitor, eliminating the need for a separate tower. Memory:  With 8 GB of memory, the system is smooth when accessing videos and multitasking with multiple applications simultaneously without any significant performance bottlenecks.   It would have been great if they had had 16GB for this price range as RAM are so cheap these days.Storage: The 512GB SSD provides a decent amount of storage space for storing all the required files and pictures.  We do have a 2TB SSD drive that we use to backup all our data including our pictures, so this was not a major factor in our decision.  SSD drive offers faster read and write speeds compared to traditional hard drivers and boots quicker like laptop and reduces application loading.  Also, reduces heat production and runs smoothly with no hard drive noise. Love it.Design:  All-in-one systems like this are a very sleek and space-saving design and is very advantageous if you needed a clutter-free setup with minimal wires or towers.  It does come with WiFi6 for greater reliability and faster wireless access.  Also, it comes with built-in media SD memory card reader for quick photo transfer from camera.  It features USB Type-C USB3 gen2 ports for quick connect smartphones. Pros: Space-saving design, touch screen functionality, integrated speakers and peripherals, WiFi6, Type C USB Gen2 ports, Sleek and minimalist black look, Easy setup.Cons: Limited upgradability, Price point, limited display size options, repair complexity if it fails.Overall, it suits our specific use cases and is a personal choice as there are better performance available with laptops/desktops these days for this price point.  Highly recommend for anyone who needs a space saving design.'}",The person likes to watch movies on this laptop,1,0.84

Your instructions are tooi involved.  And, even to this day, if i need to know something about my new computer, I go to Google.   I think a lot of other old timers like myself are doing the same thing.    Google have just the right questions and answers to help me use my new computer.     I don""t want to be a complainer and I don""t want to blame Dell for my lack of knowledge.    I guess you have to make a book for dummies - old people who haven""t had a new computer in 20 years.   I am 77 years old and all this new stuff is just too much for my mind to grasp.     So far, I can do just the the basics like find my email, pay my bills, see my bank account.    I know there is so much more this computer can do, but it is too much to try to figure out.     Right now I am trying to figure out how to get my printer to print a copy of my online phone bill.
