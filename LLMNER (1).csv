Design is esthetically appealing and refined. Unbelievably lightweight! Processing power and responsiveness is incredible. The pen is a nice and welcomed edition to match with the flexibility of this PC. Definitely can expect a full day of use up to 12 hours, based on settings. Typing is good, about average, certainly comfortable and accurate. Monitor is bright and images really pop, color accuracy is well calibrated.Why 4 stars instead of 5, you ask? I deducted 1 star for battery life and not offering a 4K display. I have not experienced any issues with battery drain or wanting for a sharper image; it""s just that I expect both from a top product such as this. I researched and compared other high end models from HP, Lenovo, Dell and Apple. Comparable features and specs were either not matched or as in the case with Apple nearly double the cost. In the end this struck the right balance for my needs with portability (storage too) being very high on the list. Speaking of list, compare to any other and you will find it is top of the line latest features (Windows, Memory, Intel etc.)Again, I highly recommend and am very much pleased with Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 2 360.'}",positive,WorkAction,WorkTasks,Processor,WorkingAbility,Person,Home,,positive,WorkAction,Processor,WorkingAbility,Person,Home,WorkTasks,both

It was purchased to replace our almost 10 year old 17"" touchscreen Dell that still looks brand new but is no longer supported because of windows 8.1. We treat our electronics correctly, and normally get years of use out of them. We have used numerous Samsung Galaxy phones and love them, including our latest S22 Ultra. (We traded in our Note 8 phones that were still pristine) After getting the Book2 home, and it being used sparingly while sitting on the table, we could see the crack on the screen all the way from the left to the right. The crack is almost invisible, mainly seen when looking from the top of the screen. The laptop starts up correctly and the screen looks bright and clear, except for the faint line from the crack.

At the time of the first purchase, I was using PC based operating systems, and I was frankly, sick and tired of PC""s going obsolete quick, or breaking down due to poor quality. So I went the Apple route and I never looked back. I was originally looking to purchase the cheaper Macbook Air until I read that the computer throttles down when it overheats. So I looked at the next one up. It had no mag safe charger, a must have in my opinion. I""ve seen too many PC""s with damaged motherboards because of torquing between the cord and unit. So I ended up with this MacBook. This mac is very fast with the M3 chip, although the M2 would have been ok. But the mag safe wasn""t available on that one, so I was back to this model. I wanted to get more RAM but the price was too much. In the old days of using PCs, I""d simply put more RAM in. But you can""t do this with this mac. They use what they call unified RAM, and its said that 8 MB (or unified), is like 16 onboard RAM. That was ok with me....as long as I no longer got that long lag time due to the system.Other pro""s:Graphics are good.In addition to password protection there is fingerprint access.Speed is goodWIFI Connectivity goodMag safe chargingSIRI availableCons: PriceGet a Mac......future proof yourself.'}",positive,WorkAction,WorkTasks,Processor,WorkingAbility,Person,Universal,,positive,ru,speed,pro,Person,Universal,WorkTasks,both

If you upgrade the RAM to 32 GB Corsair Vengeance (also sold at bestbuy) you can increase the CPU score by about 600 points (see images). With a strong OC on the GPU ( 280 MHz core ,  1250 MHz memory) you can manage around a 11,400 timespy graphics score which is roughly equivalent to a 150 watt 3070 Ti. Maximum GPU power consumption with OC was 108 watts, averaging around 103 watts, so the efficiency gains here are incredible. I actually managed to get 4th place in the world on TimeSpy for the 13700HX   4060 combo on stock hardware, that to me is incredible and speaks to the laptops excellent thermals/design. the GPU wants to boost past 2800 MHz for me, but it just cant because of VRel (Voltage reliability) It simply screams for more voltage, but nearly 2800 Mhz is incredible.   Liquid metal is the stock thermal paste and helps a lot! At stocks settings you""ll see roughly 90-100 watt GPU power usage, shame Nvidia limited these chips to 1 volt, but the efficiency is crazy, this laptop benches about the same as a 140 watt 3070, but uses much less power, so the temps dont exceed high 60 Celsius range. The 13700HX is incredibly powerful and as mentioned before, gains about 600 points in TimeSpy CPU score if you upgrade the RAM to a decent kit. It will pull up to 157 watts so it pairs very well with the GPU that wont usually go past 100 watts, combined this is a very powerful laptop that realistically could be a desktop replacement for many. The stock 1 TB NVMe drive is a Micron_3400_MTFDKBA1T0TFH , with speeds of 6500 MB/s read and 5000 MB/s write (See crystal disk mark image attached). There IS a second NVMe slot available, and a screw is included as well pre installed in the laptop, so adding another drive is easy! I did add another 2 TB NVMe drive and it was no problem, you""ll see it in one of the images attached. Im not sure why another reviewer claimed there was only one slot, but that information is very false and incorrect. RAM upgrade is similarly easy and can also be seem in an attached image. Taking the bottom cover off is also very easy. RAM/SSD upgrade should take you no longer than 10-15 mins. The screen is AU Optronics B160QAN03.H , its quite good and a very bright, I am impressed with it, it belongs in a laptop of this class.The stock RAM is Samsung M425R1GB4  8GB x 2 with timings of : 40-39-39-76 @ 4800 MHz with tRC 115 and tRFC 383. Its decent enough memory, but even the 4800 MHz Corsair Vengeance 16 GB sticks sold by BestBuy will provide a performance uplift (as seen in TimeSpy CPU score).I also updated the BIOS to the latest version 1.10 with no issues, the laptop came with version 1.06 Im impressed with the fan noise at idle/web browsing. Some laptops will sit there and nearly scream when in turbo mode, but not this one, its clear the cooling system with liquid metal easily absorbs any heat spikes without issue. the fans are also made of metal, which is quite unique and feels very premium and may even have some small performance benefit as metal is a better material for a fan in terms of heat dissipation. It will get loud during a full load benchmark but that is to be expected, but it ramps down very quickly after the load comes off.I also love the fact that the laptop has a MUX switch, but will also function automatically! this is great tech, so you dont have to worry about changing the switch all the time to get max performance from the 4060. You""ll get a notification and the screen may flash momentarily when it switches the display to the DGPU or iGPU, this is normal. Overall amazing laptop and highly recommend!'}",positive,WorkAction,WorkTasks,Processor,WorkingAbility,Person,Universal,,positive,UpgradeAction,ProcessingUnit,UpgradingAbility,Person,Universal,WorkTasks,both

I only had to buy a new computer because my older HP Spectre 360 was no longer updating properly. I started looking at Lenova Yoga Book but did not love the price and it was on back order. I tried to wait and research computers more. Almost got the Spectre again (it was a good computer). Then finally another update and my Spectre was just about unworkable and could not wait to get new computer. I then needed one urgently which is not the best way to do it. I had at least looked at the Lenova so much and I saw how far they have come. I love the design and ease of use. I also really love the OLED screens on the computer. The only issue I have had is sometimes the fingerprint log in does not work. One night no matter what I did it would not let me in. I also could not get my password to work. I became quite worried indeed but after hard restart it worked fine and has never happened again. IIt had an update recently and since then not had issues logging in with fingerprint. Otherwise, it has been very fast turn on and go. No issues with my work applications (citrix). I like Lenova""s set up. I like the pen that comes with it but i really wish they had a way of attaching to computer, prior versions appeared to have a pocket. I am so afraid of loosing it that I keep not using it and leaving it at home. I think they should find a way to attach even if it could only be used while not in computer case.I am not a computer tech person. I know have good basic knowledge and get myself out of some basic computer issues but am not going to get into computer lingo. If you work in health care and have to chart forever on various remote desktops or perhaps do video telemed-this computer will do the job and also be fun to use when not doing such work. I am still going to buy a portable monitor to make travel work easier but am glad I purchased this one. The battery live is average. I had hoped it would be longer, but it is certainly workable.
